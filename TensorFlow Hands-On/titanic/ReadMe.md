TensorFlow on windows 10

I used anaconda to run TensorFlow on windows 10. 

Install anaconda 64 bit installer (Python 3.6 version) 

open terminal from anaconda and Create conda environment by running following command

conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda

conda create -n py35 python=3.5

refer this link - https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/


thenn go to the py35 environment created above and install Jupyter notebook 

you can now open the jupyter notebook and run TensorFlow.


You can also use docker container to run tensorflow.
